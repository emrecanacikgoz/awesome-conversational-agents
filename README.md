Paper lists for "Conversational Agents: A Survey of Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions"

## ðŸ’« Introduction
The development of conversational agents has always been an area of keen interest within artificial intelligence (AI) research, representing a significant step towards creating interactive systems capable of human-like understanding, communication, and acting. Conversational agents are chat-based AI systems that aim to interact with users in a human-like manner by understanding their input, engaging in meaningful communication, and performing actions based on the userâ€™s intent and context.

In recent years, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has further accelerated the progress of Conversational Agents. LLMs now serve as the backbone of many state-of-the-art conversational systems, seamlessly integrating with APIs and databases to perform complex multi-step tasks, such as restaurant reservations or calling a taxi. This integration allows agents to interact with external services, access up-to-date information, and ensure task completion by providing users with more dynamic, context-driven, and reliable experiences.

This paper presents a thorough survey of the recent advancements, challenges, and future research directions in the scope of conversational agents. We begin by establishing a taxonomy that categorizes conversational agents according to their prompting strategies, training data formats, fine-tuning methods, and evaluation protocols. Next, we discuss recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding, dialogue management, and response generation by highlighting the contributions of LLMs in these areas and how agents can relate those. Subsequently, we examine various challenges that remain, such as handling multi-turn and multi-agent interactions, the personalization of dialogues, and addressing safety concerns. Finally, we outline potential future directions, such as the integration of cleaner and more advanced datasets,improved training strategies for agentic purposes and the development of more holistic evaluation frameworks for conversational agents.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of conversational agents, shedding light on the strides made with LLMs, addressing key challenges, and outlining future directions to guide the continued evolution of intelligent, context-aware dialogue systems.
